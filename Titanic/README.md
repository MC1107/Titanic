### Introduction: This is my first Kaggle challenge - I am new to machine learning so any comments are welcome! I'm taking on this challenge because it is specifically designed to cultivate my skills in:
- binary classification
- basic machine learning R skills

All data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

1.1  Download Packages Import Datasets & Check-up

Download packages for data manipulation & visualization 
Import datasets from the associated directory. Also did a simple check-up on the variables and their class types. 


1.2 Data Prep/Cleaning

Replace missing data in the three variables - age, fare & embarked 

2 EDA

Exploratory data analysis: to check variable of interest's relationship with the survival rate

2.1 Age vs. Survial 
2.2 Sex vs Survival
2.3 Pclass vs Survival 
2.4 Family size vs Survival
---


Bugs & Questions:

1. Based on what standards should I choose whether to use median/mode/random sample for missing data replacement?

2. For EDA, what is the success measurement?(how fo I know the right time to stop) Do I have to do EDA on all indepedent variables? Or just variables of interest? 

3. Difference between Combined[1:891] and train?
