### Introduction: This is my first Kaggle challenge - I am new to machine learning so any comments are welcome! I'm taking on this challenge because it is specifically designed to cultivate my skills in:
- binary classification
- basic machine learning R skills

All data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

1.1  Download Packages Import Datasets & Check-up

Download packages for data manipulation & visualization 
Import datasets from the associated directory. Also did a simple check-up on the variables and their class types.
